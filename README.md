FleetDB is a document-oriented, persistent, main-memory database.

FleetDB combines the flexibility of schema-less documents with the indexing and querying capabilities of traditional databases. In-memory functional data structures provide high performance and excellent concurrency characteristics while append-only logging to disk provides full persistence.

Status
------

FleetDB is currently being actively developed. Note that some features are not yet implemented and that the API is unstable.
