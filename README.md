FleetDB is a record-oriented, persistent, main-memory database implemented in Clojure and Java.

FleetDB combines the flexibility of schema-less records with the declarative indexing and querying capabilities of traditional databases. In-memory functional data structures provide high performance and excellent concurrency characteristics while append-only logging to disk provides complete durability.
